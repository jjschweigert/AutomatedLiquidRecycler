# Automated Liquid Recycler
Liquid transfer system that allows a user to schedule or manually recycle the current liquid in the system and replace it with a fresh volume.

## Motivation
The goals of this project are
* To explore arduino/prototyping expansion boards that are used for liquid transfer/pumping
* To understand how to measure liquid flow and how to only gather the necessary amount of new liquid from a source.
* To build a general application with the specific use case of recycling a pet's water source in a residential setting
